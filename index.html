                    <br>This night is cold in the kingdom
                    <br>I can feel you fade away
                    <br>From the kitchen to the bathroom sink and
                    <br>Your steps keep me awake
                    <br>Don't cut me down, throw me out, leave me here to waste
                    <br>I once was a man with dignity and grace
                    <br>Now I'm slipping through the cracks of your cold embrace
                    <br>So please, please
                    <br>Could you find a way to let me down slowly?
                    <br>A little sympathy, I hope you can show me
                    <br>If you wanna go, then I'll be so lonely
                    <br>If you're leaving, baby let me down slowly
                    <br>Let me down, down
                    <br>Let me down, down
                    <br>Let me down, let me down
                    <br>Down, let me down, down
                    <br>Let me down
                    <br>If you wanna go, then I'll be so lonely
                    <br>If you're leaving, baby let me down slowly
                    <br>Cold skin, drag my feet on the tile
                    <br>As I'm walking down the corridor
                    <br>And I know we haven't talked in a while
                    <br>So I'm looking for an open door
                    <br>Don't cut me down, throw me out, leave me here to waste
                    <br>I once was a man with dignity and grace
                    <br>Now I'm slipping through the cracks of your cold embrace
                    <br>So please, please
                    <br>Could you find a way to let me down slowly?
                    <br>A little sympathy, I hope you can show me
                    <br>If you wanna go, then I'll be so lonely
                    <br>If you're leaving, baby let me down slowly
                    <br>Let me down, down
                    <br>Let me down, down
                    <br>Let me down, let me down
                    <br>Down, let me down, down
                    <br>Let me down

                    <br>If you're leaving, baby let me down slowly
                    <br>And I can't stop myself from falling down
                    <br>And I can't stop myself from falling down
                    <br>And I can't stop myself from falling down
                    <br>And I can't stop myself from falling down
                    <br>Could you find a way to let me down slowly?

                    <br>Let me down, down
                    <br>Let me down, down
                    <br>Let me down, let me down
                    <br>Down, let me down, down
